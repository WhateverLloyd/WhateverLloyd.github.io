## About Me

<img src="./images/headshot.jpg" height="240" width="240">

I recently graduated with a MS in environmental studies from the College of Charleston. For my thesis, I worked with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources on a Sea Grant-funded project exploring connections among land use, climate change, and coastal ecosystems. Through my research project, I learned to manage and analyze complex, environmental datasets using R and GIS. Prior to grad school, I worked around the country as a field biologist with the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service.<br/>
